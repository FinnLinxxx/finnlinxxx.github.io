# Install ROS for Geodesy calibration Project at TU Wien

Kubuntu is installed. 

Install ROS for Ubuntu (18.04.x LTS) as described [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).

We are going to use ROS to move the Universal Robotics (UR) arm, located at TU Wien Lab. 
Therefore [this](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) package is used. 

Beforehand we need some extra packages (dependancies for ur package), provided by the [moveIt!](http://moveit.ros.org/) proejct.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-moveit
```

To integrate the UR-Package please get familiar with the inner behaivior of ROS Packages and catkin as described in the [ROS Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).

Navigate into the scr-folder of your project (catkin_ws is just a dummy name), clone the ur-package and build it.

```bash
$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```
