# Install ROS for Geodesy calibration Project at TU Wien

Kubuntu is installed. Install ROS for Ubuntu (18.04.x LTS) as described [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).
We are going to use ROS to move the Universal Robotics (UR) arm, located at TU Wien Lab. Therefore [this](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) package
is used. 

Beforehand we need some extra packages (dependancies for ur package), provided by the [moveIt!](http://moveit.ros.org/) proejct.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-moveit
```
