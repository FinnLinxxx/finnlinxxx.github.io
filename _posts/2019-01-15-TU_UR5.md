## Create ROS project to manouver the UR5

Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver with ROS Melodic Setup.

Of course [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) needs to be installed first, be also aware of installing the ros melodic moveit driver and some other packages beforehand.

```bash
$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-moveit
$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-joint-trajectory-controller
```

Setup new workspace and clone industrial_core from repository which supports needed ros-messages and various dependancies. Be aware that this repository does not support melodic naturally yet, but the kinetic-devel branch is good enough (as of 15.01.2019). 
```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir workspace_TU
$ cd workspace_TU
$ mkdir src
$ cd src
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core.git
```

Next up the universal robotics driver is downloaded which beholds some more dependancies, once again the kinetic-devel branch is used as there is no melodic support yet.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot.git
```
As the UR5 from TU Wien comes with version 3.5 we do need the [ur_modern_driver](https://github.com/ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver). This time we need to checkout the kinetic-devel branch manually. 

Now all needed packages are setup and we are able to compile with catkin

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver.git
$ cd ur_modern_driver
$ git checkout kinetic-devel
$ cd ../..
$ catkin_make
```

this may take a minute.

Source the freshly made setup in every new terminal by sourcing it in the .bashrc
```bash
$ echo "source ~/workspace_TU/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

done. Please close all open terminals and restart them before first use.

## Use workspace to control a UR5-Robot in Gazebo

With Gazebo simulation you need at least 3 seperate terminals, limited:=true may not be needed.
```bash
$ roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5.launch limited:=true
$ roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true limited:=true
$ roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch config:=true
```

## Use workspace to control the real UR5-Robot
To make first contact with the real robot do follow these steps as decribed [here](http://wiki.ros.org/universal_robot/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20a%20Universal%20Robot%20and%20ROS-Industrial) (version 3.X). This setup once worked, needs some more testing to approve again.

**Remember that you should always have your hands on the big red button in case there is something in the way or anything unexpected happens.**

```bash
$ roscore
```
In a new terminal

```bash
$ roslaunch ur_bringup ur5_bringup.launch robot_ip:=192.168.178.5
```
In a new terminal
```bash
$ cd ~
$ cd workspace_TU/src/ur_modern_driver
$ python test_move.py
```

Manipulate test_move.py to see different results.

## Use workspace to control the real UR5-Robot in rviz (tested)

Normal and cartesian planning works but some more experience is needed. The previous setup need some more testing, as it was not reproducable. This setup is already tested and do work for the TU Wien UR5-Robot and its static ip address! 

```bash
$ roslaunch ur_modern_driver ur5_bringup.launch robot_ip:=192.168.178.5
$ roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch
$ roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch config:=true
```


After some testing planning and movement of the robot with rviz, as described in chapter [3.6](http://wiki.ros.org/universal_robot/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20a%20Universal%20Robot%20and%20ROS-Industrial) works as well.

**Be aware of the locale issue!**
You may need to change locale options, if the rviz robot visualization appears buggish.

```bash
$ export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
```
