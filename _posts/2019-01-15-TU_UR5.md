## Create ROS project to manouver the UR5

Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver with ROS Melodic Setup.

Setup new workspace and clone industrial_core from repository which supports needed ros-messages and various dependancies. Be aware that this repository does not support melodic naturally yet, but the kinetic-devel branch is good enough (as of 15.01.2019). 
```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir workspace_TU
$ cd workspace_TU
$ mkdir src
$ cd src
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_core.git
```

Next up the universal robotics driver is downloaded which beholds some more dependancies, once again the kinetic-devel branch is used as there is no melodic support yet.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot.git
```
As the UR5 from TU Wien comes with version 3.5 we do need the [ur_modern_driver](https://github.com/ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver). This time we need to checkout the kinetic-devel branch manually. 

Now all needed packages are setup and we are able to compile with catkin

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/ur_modern_driver.git
$ cd ur_modern_driver
$ git checkout kinetic-devel
$ cd ../..
$ catkin_make
```

this may take a minute.

Source the freshly made setup in every new terminal by sourcing it in the .bashrc
```bash
$ echo "source ~/workspace_TU/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

done. Please close all open terminals and restart them before first use.

## Use workspace to control the UR5-Robot

To make first contact with the real robot do follow these steps as decribed [here](http://wiki.ros.org/universal_robot/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20a%20Universal%20Robot%20and%20ROS-Industrial) (version 3.X). Its already tested and do work for the TU Wien UR5-Robot and its static ip address!

**Remember that you should always have your hands on the big red button in case there is something in the way or anything unexpected happens.**

```bash
$ roscore
```
In a new terminal

```bash
$ roslaunch ur_bringup ur5_bringup.launch robot_ip:=192.168.178.5
```
In a new terminal
```bash
$ cd ~
$ cd workspace_TU/src/ur_modern_driver
$ python test_move.py
```

Manipulate test_move.py to see different results.


After some testing planning and movement of the robot with rviz, as described in chapter [3.6](http://wiki.ros.org/universal_robot/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20a%20Universal%20Robot%20and%20ROS-Industrial) works as well.

**Be aware of the locale issue!**
You may need to change locale options, if the rviz robot visualization appears buggish.

```bash
$ export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
```
